# 🗽 Microsoft Fabric NYC Taxi Data Project

Welcome to this comprehensive Microsoft Fabric data project, which demonstrates an **end-to-end data warehousing pipeline** using **New York City TLC Taxi data**. This project integrates **Data Lakehouse**, **Data Factory**, **Data Warehouse**, and **Power BI** to showcase a modern, scalable analytics solution.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project processes and analyzes **NYC Yellow Taxi trip records** by building a modern data architecture using Microsoft Fabric. The solution demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline, moving data from raw files to insightful dashboards through layered transformations and modeling.

We leverage the following components:

- **Data Lakehouse** – to store both raw and curated data  
- **Data Warehouse** – to host structured, query-optimized data for reporting and analytics  
- **Data Factory Pipelines** – for orchestrating ETL workflows across layers  
- **Dataflows and Stored Procedures** – for transforming data between staging and presentation layers  
- **Power BI** – for semantic modeling and building interactive reports

## 📂 Data Source

We use publicly available **TLC Trip Record Data (Yellow Taxi)** from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission.

## 🔁 Project Workflow

The project follows a structured workflow across the data lifecycle:

### 1️⃣ Raw Data Landing  
- NYC taxi CSV files are stored in a **Data Lakehouse** in the `landing` zone

### 2️⃣ Staging Layer  
- A **Data Factory Pipeline** moves and formats raw data to the `staging` zone  
- Transformations are applied using **Notebooks** and **Dataflows**

### 3️⃣ Presentation Layer  
- Cleaned data is moved to the `presentation` zone  
- Further transformations are handled by **Dataflows** or **Stored Procedures**

### 4️⃣ Power BI Modeling  
- A **semantic model** is created on top of the presentation data  
- **Power BI** reports and dashboards are built to derive insights
